# Big Joel's Safari

My local petting zoo is a mere 6 years old and has an outdated, text-based website. 
I want to rebuild their site and give it user-focused features with room to grow. 
I want the zoo to have a more professional web presence to help drive traffic. 
I have attempted to fully produce as much content as possible over the course of the 
8 week capstone program, with a special focus on 4 key features.

## Features

1. Order form: I want to work towards having the option to order season-passes online.
1. Calendar: A built-in Google Calendar with the operation hours listed.
1. Database: A searchable database of the types of animals in the zoo and information about each one.
1. Search bar: Lastly, I will implement a search bar and make the site fully searchable.

## Old Screenshot

The current site is somewhat overwhelmingly text-based, and not mobile friendly.
