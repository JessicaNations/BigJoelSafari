                Fall time is park owners, Big Joel and Mimi's favorite time of the year!
                They love to decorate for the fall season and especially for Halloween, transforming Big Joel's Safari into Big Joel's Spooky Safari!
                The wagon ride takes you in our old hay wagon with our trusty old tractor on a tour through our large field, which is home to our deer,
                elk, bison, and watusi cattle as well as our many ducks and geese.
                During the tour, our ride operator will inform you about our animal residents and facts about Big Joel's Safari!
